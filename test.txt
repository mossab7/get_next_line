Paroles
Too sick, yeah we're too sick
Another man down, just another toothpick
Too sick, yeah we're too sick
Mars attacks, we had to kill 'em with the music, uh
Only bump this music loud
Shoot your guns through the clouds
Rude boy style
I'm Stephen Paddock how I'm moving crowds
Putrid bowels, they screw-facing when we drop this shit
We got everyone's attention like a topless chick
Okay, off we go, time to get in party mode, cardio
They better run we're dropping that tsunami flow
Adios, ask about us, we too gnarly yo
Half the crowd has telepathic powers 'cause they already know
We kill 'em old school like a pandemic with fleas
Kill 'em new school like a pangolin disease
The planet's in a freeze, they panic when we sneeze
They can mask up but we still gon' handle 'em with ease
Lights out, easy like a candle in the breeze
You just an antelope and I'm a panther in the trees
Feast-time, I'm a beast and it's beef time
Consider this a middle finger to your peace-sign, I'm
Too sick, yeah I'm too sick
Another man down, just another toothpick
Too sick, yeah we're too sick
Mars attacks, we had to kill 'em with the music
Too sick, yeah I'm too sick
Too sick, yeah we're too sick
Too sick, yeah I'm too sick
Mars attacks, we had to kill 'em with the music, uh
We bring the ruckus like a Wu-Tang record
You better believe it if the newsman said it
This flu pandemic is too damn deadly and you can get it
New fans spread it just like the Wuhan medic
Move man, leg it, you better get your soup cans ready
Gather a few damn pennies or keep a few grand buried
Grow your fruit and veggie, never get up out your couch
We gon' get you the very second you stepping out your house
And that's some true shit (true shit)
Keep this out your speakers, don't be stupid (stupid)
They sneeze and catch a fever when the groove hits (groove hits)
Region after region, man we move quick
All the world leaders can't believe it, damn we
Too sick, yeah I'm too sick
Another man down, just another toothpick
Too sick, yeah we're too sick
Mars attacks, we had to kill 'em with the music, uh
